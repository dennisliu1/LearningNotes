    Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs[1] is a 1976 book written by Niklaus Wirth covering some of the fundamental topics of computer programming, particularly that algorithms and data structures are inherently related. For example, if one has a sorted list one will use a search algorithm optimal for sorted lists.

    The book was one of the most influential computer science books of the time and, like Wirth's other work, was extensively used in education.[2]

    The Turbo Pascal compiler written by Anders Hejlsberg was largely inspired by the Tiny Pascal compiler in Niklaus Wirth's book.
