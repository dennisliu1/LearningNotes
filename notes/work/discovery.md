- Hypothesis
    - turn questions into hypotheses:
        - given a question, think of potential solutions
        - combine question and solution -> turn it into a hypothesis
    - example:
        - we believe that [creating this experience] for [persona] will achieve [this outcome]
        - We believe that [guess] so if [event by user] then [result, measure of success]
- Experiment
    - create an experiment to test your hypothesis
    - define your experiment with a clear success criteria
- Learn & Build
    - run your experiment, collect results, feed into your decision making
